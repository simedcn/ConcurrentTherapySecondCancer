# ConcurrentTherapySecondCancer
A biologically motivated mathematical formalism is used to estimate the relative risks of breast, lung and thyroid cancers 
in childhood cancer survivors due to concurrent therapy regimen. This model specifically includes possible organ-specific 
interaction between radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The model predicts relative risks for developing secondary cancers after 
chemotherapy in breast, lung and thyroid tissues, and compared with the epidemiological data.
